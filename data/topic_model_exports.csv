Calder Interactive Persona Technology- The Gartner Group has predicted that ""By 2015, 10 percent of your online ""friends"" will be nonhuman. Social media strategy involves several steps: establishing a presence, listening to theconversation, speaking (articulating a message), and, ultimately, interacting in a two-way, fully engaged manner. Thus far, many organizations have established a presence, and are mostly projecting messages through Twitter feeds and Facebook updates that are often only an incremental step up from RSS feeds. By 2015, efforts to systematize and automate social engagement will result in the rise of social bots â€” automated software agents that can handle, to varying degrees, interaction with communities of users in a manner personalized to each individual.   Our Calder Interactive Persona Technology is making that possible today everywhere, on your PC, mobile device, Television, and your car dashboard. Calder Interactive Persona makes finding gathering, and organizing information from the internet more human.

Did you know that there are well over 15 million ""apps"" today for mobile and desktop computing devices today? Social Apps are causing fragmentation of information sources, and users have no filter or way to control the flow of information or what information we see via social network streams/feeds.  We have developed a new system that returns control to the user that makes using â€œappsâ€ optional, but through standardized social network data type plug-ins the OS has universal access to the sites youâ€™d normally access via an application, but with all of the standardized security  and personalized intelligent stream filtering per user.  We bring a consistent experience across data services and web sites via SOS and the Calder Interactive Persona that is business ""admin"" and consumer ""parent"" friendly. Privacy Concerns today are great. Users are stuck with whatever  privacy systems that are in-place per system in-web browser. We bring these streams into SOS and universally adjust privacy based on what the users needs are. SOS solves frustrations over data streams and organization lack of in-stream filtering and search capabilities that are universal over social networks by providing these capabilities.. Our solution is geared toward complete customization and synchronization over the cloud. learners need a system that allows them to not only collect and organize information, but also dynamically update and curate it.

2621,iSpye,"iSpye is a social travel application that shows places, events and people around you, in real time. The app is a travel social network that connects users and provides real time information about venues and events, relative to the users location. All content is user generated and users can find out the most popular, trending or nearby occurrences.  The aim is to provide users with a platform that allows them to discover the best things to see and do upon arriving in a new place. Built with the student ‘backpacker’ ethos at the forefront, iSpye is building a community of people who believe there are no boundaries, no such thing as too many travel connections and will never say no to a valuable life experience! The app has been built for iOS and Android devices. Version 1 has three main features, which are as follows:  •	News Feed – venues and events are displayed as pins, which are categorised and shown in the users feed in a list format. There are two features of the feed: Discover and Buzz.  Discover displays pins closest to the user and Buzz shows pins that are tending i.e. the most popular pins at any given time, relative to the users location. The popularity of a pin is defined by the community either upping or downing that pin and a trend is started by the first users activity. A user may up or down a pin through either the Discover tab (most likely while attending the pin or the morning after) or the Buzz tab (to contribute to the trend). The purpose of a users activity is to inform the community of their current experience at a venue or event and not, like tripadvisor, to rate the venue or event itself. A user may vote a pin up or down once every 24 hours, so if they return to the venue or event at a later date they may vote again. The aim is to provide the community with an accurate idea of which venues are the best or busiest at any point in time.  •	Mapping – users can drop pins to represent venues found or events occurring. Each pin is displayed at its exact location on a map and can be seen by all members of the iSpye community. By clicking on a pin, users can instantly see how many times the pin has been upped and down. The user is able to gather further information by opening the pins page. A page displays statistics (number of ups, number of downs, %age of male voters, %age of female voters and average age of voters), thoughts and IM profiles of recent users who voted on the page. Thoughts are posted by users and describe their experience of the venue. Users looking at the page are able to gain a sense of whether or not they should attend the venue or event simply by looking at the statistics, thoughts and/ or by chatting via IM (next bullet point) to users who are currently at or have previously been to the pin.   •	Instant Messaging – users can communicate with other users of the iSpye community via Instant Messages. Users are displayed according to their location and a user may chat with another user to find out information about their current or past experience(s) of a pin. The best source of information comes from locals and the IM client allows all users to obtain information in real time. The IM tab also has built in search functionality, allowing users to search for users in other cities. The purpose of search is to allow a user to begin gathering information on the city they are about to visit and meet likeminded people prior to their arrival.  iSpye allows users to tap into a global community of travellers and locals to gain an instant insight into the best and busiest places around them. iSpye will officially launch in October 2013.",14_video_users_content_videos,video - users - content - videos - knowledge - information - share - people - platform - social
