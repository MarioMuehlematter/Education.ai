## Abstract 
A dataset containing information about 14’046 businesses operating in the Education
Technology (EdTech) market was investigated regarding the adoption of Artificial
Intelligence (AI). The ventures contained in the dataset could be assigned to 23 topics,
however, none is labeled “AI”. The keywords representing said topics mostly reflect
the primary visions and customer segments. The analysis suggests that AI is only a
tool to realize these visions, therefore about the operational dimension of the business
model. The idea of AI-first EdTech companies does not appear in the self-description
of ventures listed on CrunchBase. The logical conclusion of this first analysis is that AI
is not the “hot” topic in EdTech, as it is not a topic at all. A binary classification was
added to the dataset in the second analytical step. It confirmed that Artificial
Intelligence (AI) is not the current “hot” topic in EdTech, as the distribution of AI
companies regarding size, total funding, and age appears random. As the data
revealed no trend, analyzing investor behavior regarding a trend-based bias linked to
AI was made impossible. However, the temporal analysis using Kernel Density
Estimates (KDE) on the topics resulting from the first step revealed additional insights
linked to the wider field of emerging technologies: In the past Virtual Reality (VR) was
a “hot” topic, explicitly referring to a specific technology, in the EdTech market. The
association with this “hot” topic influenced investor behavior negatively, the
ventures founded during the hype phase with growing interest in VR received less
funding on average than both VR business across the entire dataset and the wider
EdTech peer group founded within the same timeframe. This finding partly validates
the concept of “smart money”, as professional investors do not overinvest based on a
trend-driven bias.
