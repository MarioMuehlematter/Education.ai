## About (Needs Update)

This online repository contains the code needed to reconstruct the tables and figures from the paper. The following notebooks contain the code: 

- **Notebook A**. Text Classification with a Bag-of-Words Representation [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_JsC9opZjrI4p-V_5ojWO_6JAYEt2xcs?usp=sharing)
- **Notebook B**. Text Classification with a Embedding Based Text Representation [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pC-c2z7_laajvOZ4Rky8AfjoMx_kq1uB?usp=sharing)
- **Notebook C**. Text Classification using a Convolutional Neural Network [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11it0K0wOOLzf9fWvs1eFaFHA-R_bNVB9?usp=sharing)
- **Notebook D**. Text CLassification using Transformer Based Models [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AGiy2zggSVMwO7OYPaOujw9hHN6Jb7mj?usp=sharing)
- **Notebook X**. Summary and Comparison of Different Classification Approaches [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1U9SN_vWDveJhsb_RbqxGH0DDMqTui4Y0?usp=sharing)

Notebooks are shown in GitHub but you can explore and open in Google Colab to replicate and utilize in own research projects.
